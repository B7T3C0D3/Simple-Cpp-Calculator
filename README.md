# Simple-Cpp-Calculator
 A simple C++ Calculator with couple basics functions.
 note - I am a beginner coder so basicly the code might look poorly in coding aesthetics.
 I uploaded this code to simply check my adventure in C++.

 Also you're free to use it in your adventure too, in school projects etc.
 Good luck future coders.

Just download this whole repository, copy WhileLoop folder wherever you store your projects, open WhileLoop.sln - should work.
